## Vision
poapedu aims to provide each builder their universal skill profile on EDU Chain by consolidating everything they have ever learned, made, and achieved.

üê∏ poapedu is an education infrastructure platform built on EDU Chain that allows builders to consolidate their learnings and achievements for career and skill planning.

### Problem
ü§î How do we prove that we‚Äôve learned and achieve? If you‚Äôre thinking of certifications, you‚Äôre right. Young adults, especially lifelong learners, accumulate anywhere between 10-30 online and offline, on-chain and off-chain badges and certificates across multiple platforms in their pursuit of knowledge.

This fragmentation has led to learners finding it challenging to consolidate their learnings to present a comprehensive profile of who they are, what they have done, and what they can do. Apart from that, the fragmentation lends to a less-than-ideal learning journey and the learners have to identify what steps to take next.

### Solution

üß± We want to consolidate their online and offline, on-chain and off-chain certification and badges through a comprehensive set of wallet and certificate connectors.

- poapedu NFTs: each badge and certificate has 1:1 poapedu NFT equivalent on EDU Chain.
- Skill mapper: we parse the curriculum from each badge and certificate and derive skill tags for the user. These skill tags are then mapped onto different roles, presenting an intuitive skill gap analysis for the learner

### Traction
We are partnering up with [Metacamp](https://metacamp.so/), a leading web3 coding academy based in Singapore. They store their students' certificates on Solana, and they'll be working with us on badging the certs on EDU Chain as well.

### Current and future roadmap

üí∞ While consolidation is the our step, we‚Äôre passionate about outcomes ‚Äì jobs and income opportunities. Learners can either proceed with educating themselves further, or partake in income-generating opportunities. We hope that on-chain certification and proof of learning leads to more employment opportunities, be it off-chain or via OC ecosystem.

## #Impact
‚õìÔ∏è With this, we bring value to not just learners but EDU Chain as well. Minting poapedu NFTs will bring TPS to EDU Chain. Additionally, we contribute to a vibrant upskilling ecosystem by cross-referrals, e.g., we send learners to other OC ecosystem players, and learners from OC ecosystem players can join poapedu to get their profile.
